Storage system:
--------------
2 types:

1.file system
2.data base system



Storage systems:

there are 2 types of storage systems.1)file system 2)data base system.

1)file system:

Disadvantages with file system
	1)Does not stored in formated way
	2)Complexity in modifications 
	3)Data redundancy cannot be avoided 
	4)Limit in size

Data:
-----
Data is collection of raw facts.

Information:
-----------
it is formated data.

The system that maintain or manages data is called data base system or data base managent system(DBMS).
It stores data in tabular format.



				student==>entity
			
			st.no	st.name		st.marks==>attributes
			 101	abc		250
			 102    xyz		300 ====>tuple



Dr.E.F.Codd as proposed 12 rules which are called as codd rules
A system will be called as data base system it would satisfy min of 5 codd rules.



DBMS maintains hole data at same level to overcomne this HDBMS is introduced.(Hirerical Data Base Management System)






							    1==>root node
						2			3
					4	5	6	7	8	9==>child node
							10			11


NDBMS provides centralized data base(Network DBMS).

					   c --	S
					      /	 \		
					     c	 c
S--server & c--client

RDBMS (Relational DBMS).
6 codd rules are satisfied when it is RDBMS.

ORDBMS or OORDBMS(Object oriented RDBMS) .



				TOOLS
				=====

1.Dbase
2.Paradox
3.
4.MS-Access	----> satisfy 5 codd rules
5.Ingrees	----> satisfy 6 codd rules
6.Post grace	----> satisfy 6 codd rules
7.MS-SQL Server ----> satisfy 9 - 10 codd rules
8.mMyspl 	----> satisfy 6 codd rules
9.DB2		----> satisfy 11 codd rules
10.Sybase	----> satisfy 11 1/2 codd rules
11.Oracle	----> satisfy 12 codd rules


eveery data base have 2structures

SQL
Programing
	--Oracle/my-SQL it is called as PL/SQL
	--My-SQL server it is called as T-SQl
	--Sybase/db2 it is called programing SQL




				My-SQL
				======

SQL --structured query language

5 types of commands to work with SQL

1)DDL--Data Definition Language
------
In DDL there are 5 commands create,alter,drop,truncate,rename
2)DML --Data Manuplation Language
-----
In DML there are 3 commands insert ,delete,update

3)DRL --Data Retrival Language
-----
In DRL there are 1 command select

4)TCL--Transition Control Language
-----
In TCL there are 3 commands commit,rollback,savepoint

5)DCL--Data control language
-----
In DCL there are 2 commands grant,revoke




create databse in mysql

syntax:
create database <database name>;

eq:
create database unicsol;

use <database name>;
eq;use unicsol;
 it will mandatory for starting a database.	


copy all the defualt tables from ms file

show tables;
 	if u see all the tables present in database.it is not case senitive



To retrive data :

	>select column name1,column name2,-.... from table name;

Do u know columns in presence of table is command describe
then syntax: desc table name;
