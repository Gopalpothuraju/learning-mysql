sum of the sal with each depts.
we can use 'group by clause'. it is used to group the similar values.
	   -----------------	
select deptno,sum(sal)  from emp group by deptno;


select job,sum(sal)  from emp group by job;

select deptno,count(*) from emp group by deptno;

select job,count(*) from emp group by job;

HAVING CLAUSE
having clause is used when group functions are used in conditions.

select deptno,sum(sal) from emp group by deptno having sum(sal)>9000;

ALIAS
====
It is used to display temporary column name for exact column name
alias name is written in double qoutes " ".

select deptno,sum(sal) "Total sal" from emp group by deptno having sum(sal)>9000;
select deptno,min(sal) "Minimum" max(sal) "maximum" avg(sal) "average",sum(sal) "Total sal",count(*) "NO.of emp" from emp group by deptno;



Data types
==========

int==>interger values(smaller values)
bigint==>integer values(larger values)
varchar==>character with variables
char==>characters
date==>date format(yyyy-mm-dd)
lob==>images to insert

Creation of table
=================

syntax
--------

create table <tablename>(colname datatype size,colname datatype size ,....);

create-->used to create table
here we can use 250 tables


conventions to create table:
---------------------------
1.Table name mush start with alphabet.
2.table name can't have spaces and special characters other than" _ and $".
3.doublicate names can't be allocated.


create table student (sno int(3),sname varchar(10),marks int(4));


Insert
======

To insert data in table

insert into tablename values (co1/val , co2/val,co3/val);

insert into student values(1,'gopal',80);


insert into student values(2,'sai',70);

insert into student values(3,'vinay',90);

insertion into few columns
=========================
syntax 
insert into tablename (colnamemcolname,...)  values(val1,val2);

ex
insert into student(sno,sname) values(4,'adi');

UPDATE
======
it is used to modify updated data
syntax:
update tablename set colname=value,colname2=value,.....[where condition];

ex:
update student set marks=150 where sno=2;


update from student marks=100 where marks is null;

for NULL 'is' operatoer is used.


Delete
=====

used to delete data
syntax: delete from tablename [where condition];

delete from student where sno=1;

**************all DDL commands are auto commit commands************



ALTER
======
It is used to modify structure of the table.

increasing/decreasing the columns width

syntax:
alter table tablename modify colname datatype size;

ex:
alter table student modify sno int(5);

when the col width has to be decrease such col should not consist any data.
