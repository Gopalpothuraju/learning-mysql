
syntax :
select colname,colname2,.... from tablename;
ex:
select empno,ename,mgr,job from emp;

colname not present in any order but its column should present in table
its not case senitive
we can fetch all fields in table use "*"

syntax:
select * from tablename;
ex:
select * from emp;
**mysql date format is yyyy-mm-dd**




WHERE 
=====


syntax:

select * from tablename where [condition];

ex: select * from emp where job!='manager';
	select * from emp where job<>'manager';
these 2 cokmmands are not equal symbols

select * from emp where job='manager' or job='clerk';

select * from emp where job='manager' and deptno=10;

IN
==


select * from emp where deptno in(10,20);


select * from emp where sal in(1300,3000);

these operator can fetch the matching values in table
multiple values can be compared.
Matching values can be fetched .non matching values can be ignored

NOT IN
======

select * from emp where sal not in(1300,3000);
it can fetch non matching values from the table.

BETWEEN
=======

select * from emp where sal between 2000 and 3000;

it fetches in the range and value deed not present in the table.

select * from emp where sal not between 2000 and 3000;
 it feteches exclusive of the range



NULL 
===

select * from emp where comm is null;
select * from emp where comm is not null;

we can use 'is' operator to use null values to fatch.
 


LIKE
====
like operator is for pattern matching.

select * from emp where ename like 'A%';

fetech names starting with letter a

select * from emp where ename like '%s';

fetches names ending with letter s

select * from emp where ename like '_____';

fetches names should have 5 characters only

select * from emp where ename like '_A%';

fetches names 2 character should have A

select * from emp where ename like '%A%';

fetches names from table there is a character should have A in any place 


DUAL
====

THere is a table called dual .to get temporary or does exit in any tables.



select sal,comm,sal+comm from emp;

30+NULL= NULL;
if we replace null value with any other values...use below queries

select sal,comm,ifnull(comm,0)+sal from emp;

or

select sal,comm,nullif(comm,0)+sal from emp;



FUNCTIONS
========

sum(sal)

select sum(sal) from emp;

min(sal)


select min(sal) from emp;


max(sal)


select max(sal) from emp;


avg(sal)


select avg(sal) from emp;


count(empno)


select count(empno) from emp;


distinct
========

dublicates are eliminate here
we can print only once

select distinct job from emp;
