JOINS
=======
To fetch relevant data from multiple tables joins are used.
3 types of joins are
1.simple join    --->equi join and non-equi join
2.outer join     --->left outer join ,right outer join and full outer join
3.self join

simple join is also called as inner join.

if u do not use any symbol in any 2 tables is called cross join and it is called as cartisien product
eq:
select * from emp,dept;

equi join
=========
we use equals to(=) symbol.
joining 2 tables using equals to(=) symbol.


eq:
select empno,ename,sal,job,dname,loc from emp,dept where emp.deptno=dept.deptno;


if i want to print deptno from about table
select empno,ename,sal,job,dname,loc,emp.deptno from emp,dept where emp.deptno=dept.deptno;

Alias names to the tables
-------------------------
select empno,ename,sal,job,dname,loc,e.deptno from emp e,dept d where e.deptno=d.deptno;

Advantages
----------
manage table name length
faster retrieval 
we can identify from which table we can to take easily.
ambiguity is remove

select e.empno,e.ename,e.sal,e.job,d.dname,d.loc,e.deptno from emp e,dept d where e.deptno=d.deptno;


NATURAL JOIN
------------

natural join also equi join
select * from emp natural join dept;
advantages
----------
no need to worry about columns in the table.




Non-equi join
-------------

joining multiple tables using other than equals to(=) operator.

eq:
select e.empno,e.ename,s.grade,e.sal from emp e,salgrade s where e.sal between s.losal and hisal;
